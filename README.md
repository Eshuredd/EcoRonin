## Features of the Game

We worked with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implemented a total of four different levels to promote these goals.

### 1) SDG Explorer
Embark on a meaningful journey through a vibrant city in **SDG Explorer**, where learning meets adventure! Your mission is to uncover the **7 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** hidden across different parts of the city. 

Explore bustling streets, serene parks, and iconic landmarks as you search for these global goals. As you approach each SDG location, a vivid display teaches you about its importance in creating a better, more sustainable world. 

Discover, learn, and connect with the values of sustainability while engaging in this unique and interactive experience. By the end of your journey, you’ll not only complete the game but also walk away as a true ambassador of the SDGs.
